  <p>I often feel that doing research is a medium for expressing my artistic self. I enjoy designing diagrams and tables for my papers, and I often obsess over color schemes and proportions of layout, I guess that's just the perfectionist in me.</p>

  <p>Claude Monet is the painter I admire most. I love his <em>paysages impressionnistes</em>, the haystacks, the cliffs, and of course, the famous water lilies.</p>

  <p>
    Valuable applications-oriented research must inevitably be rooted in user needs.
