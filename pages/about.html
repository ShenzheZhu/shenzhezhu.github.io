<h3>About Me</h3>
<div class="about-section">
  <span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
  <p>I am a 3rd-year undergraduate Computer Science student at the <a href='https://www.utoronto.ca/'>University of Toronto</a>, and currently a Research Intern at <a href='https://hai.stanford.edu/'>Stanford HAI</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a href='https://jiaxin-pei.github.io/'>Jiaxin Pei</a>.

  Starting Fall 2025, I will join the <a href='https://vectorinstitute.ai/'>Vector Institute</a> as a Research Intern. I will work with Prof. <a href='https://wenhuchen.github.io/'>Wenhu Chen</a> to develop effective frameworks for agentic AI training.

  <p>My research centers on developing trustworthy and socially responsible AI, with a focus on user-centered challenges such as bias, risk, and security vulnerabilities. Most recently, I am pretty interested in building reliable LLM agents to foster user trust.</p>
